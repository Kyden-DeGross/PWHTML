# Personal Website
This is the repository for my personal website.
## Overview
This is intended to be a learning project for front-end and back-end Web development. This will also serve as a way to learn Git and Github with more than just test repos. The goal of this project is to create a long form resume that can show off other projects and be continuously updated and improved as I learn more and more about development.
## Build
I am initially going to build this website using HTML and CSS as I have some basic knowledge of the two. This might change as I learn more about web development and implementation of different techniques.
